# 📝 To-Do List App (Add + Delete + LocalStorage)

This is a basic **To-Do List App** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.

Users can:
- Add tasks using an input field
- See each task listed
- Delete tasks individually using the ❌ button
- Refresh the page without losing their task list (thanks to **LocalStorage**)

## 🔧 Features

- Add tasks to a list dynamically
- Delete tasks using a custom ❌ button
- Persist tasks using **LocalStorage**
- DOM Manipulation with `createElement`, `appendChild`, and `remove`
